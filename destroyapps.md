title: Destroy Apps!
---

# â˜¯

App = Application (not appetizer). As always, break rules when needed.

- Don't make an app when one already exists.
- Pick the solution with the least complexity.
- Use an appropriate, standard topology.
- Don't force an app to support your unrelated task.
    - If two apps would do similar things, consider creating a shared library.

- Use good form, but don't solve problems that don't exist.
- Periodically re-evaluate if your solution is appropriate, and redesign as needed.

- Destroy shovelware and microtransactions.
- Purchase software once, use forever. Subscribe only to data access and compute resources.
