### Abstract

To advance the Resilient ExtraTerrestrial Habitat Institute's goals of designing a habitat on a planetary surface,
the exterior environment was modeled to test the system's reactions to disturbances. This study followed a
literature review characterizing the lunar impact environment performed in early 2020, and focused on turning
that information into a model in the MATLAB programming language for use with other systems being
developed by RETHi. The generation of impact events depends on a four-element Poisson process in space,
time, mass, and velocity. The dependencies between these factors were taken into account when generating
values. Covered in the report are the dependent factors, equations used, assumptions made, and resulting
data generated. These results can be useful for any planetary surface impact model, but the Moon provides a
wealth of data for generating exact values.


## Risk Assessment and Literature Review of External Environment 
### Purdue Undergraduate Research Conference, Spring 2020

### Abstract

Extraterrestrial habitats have to survive under incredibly harsh environments. This project is meant to analyze
the amount of damage done to an extraterrestrial habitat due to planetary dust interference and meteorite
impacts. A set of specifications for robotic agents meant to correct the damage done to the system can be
drawn from this research to help ensure the survival of the habitat. The habitat should be self-sustainable with
these robots such that human interference is not necessary in the maintenance of the habitat.
