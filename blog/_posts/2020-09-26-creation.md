### First!

Okay, this is the first post im making with this site setup.
I previously had a sort of a blog on Wordpress, but I was
using the free version. This was fine to me, as I always have
and adblocker running. However, one of my friends mentioned that
my site was covered in crazy ads, some of them even blocking
content. This is pretty much unacceptable, so I immediately
took down the site.

Over time, I bought a domain name, and then finally decided to set
this up. Jeckyll seems like a very user-friendly platform, and
the best part is I dont even have to strongly commit to a theme - 
Github lets you easily switch by changing one single line. How
convienient!

I'll port over some of my old posts, but honestly most of them
weren't that good. I'll have a place for thoughts like this, 
as well as a dedicated place to spotlight personal projects.
Like an art student. 

I also am considering starting a section for my text files
that I use for myself to remember how I did things. Usually
they are pretty simple - like how to use screen (without opening
the man page) or how to format and mount drives in linux. Some
are more complex how-to guides, like how to set up a rpi to 
broadcast its own wifi network that you can then ssh into the pi
from. I won't give any more spoilers ;)
