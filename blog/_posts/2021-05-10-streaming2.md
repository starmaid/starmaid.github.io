It didn't happen. School is busy, and I worked on personal projects infrequently and at random times. I sometimes did some discord screen-sharing with friends while working, which was a fun way to work on stuff for school that would have gotten me in hot water with the university if it was done on Twitch. It was also much lower stress to do impromptu streams to only like 3 or 4 people.

Either way, I don't have any regrets about it. Streaming is hard, especially when theres a billion other priorities going on.
