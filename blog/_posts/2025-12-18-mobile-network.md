I made a battery-powered LAN network setup to carry with me.

While working on my [randbeacon](https://github.com/starmaid/randbeacon) project, I wanted to manage my WLED setups at OpenSauce with an ethernet interface - so I could use my wireless card to connect to the venue's network. As you can see, the initial setup with this raspberry pi was a little clunky and annoying.

This setup fits perfectly in a backpack.
