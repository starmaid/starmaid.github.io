### Streaming

Two of my friends have started streaming on twitch fairly
frequently. While their content is wildly different from one another's,
they are each gaining a following. One thing that I was told is that
there is an interesting effect where putting yourself on camera 
forces you to be productive when accomplishing your required tasks.

I tried this out on a small scale, streaming some of the more interesting
things I was learning in class to one of my discord servers, where a
common interest was found in spaceflight. And true to that advice,
it was so much easier to stay focused and avoid distractions! Also,
when learning something for the first time, I was forced to really
gain an understanding of the concepts, because then if/when an audience
member asked about it, I would be able to answer.

## Twitch

Now that winter break is here, and I am no longer exclusively doing 
work that falls under my school's and professors' copyright claims,
I am able to start streaming my own projects on Twitch. Sitting
down with a single, achievable goal for a 2-3 hour stream,
**and then achieving that goal** within the allocated time, is
so rewarding. Especially when providing a little humor to those watching,
it makes for an enjoyable time.

## Plans

I suppose I will have to create a sort of "brand" on Twitch. This 
makes it easier for people to follow, because they know they will
be getting a consistent form of content. I think a good model comes
in the form of Micheal Reeves, a youtuber and streamer known equally
for his colorful language and his technical expertiese. Splitting
my time between projects in the field of engineering, as well as
occasional light gaming to relax sounds like a good way to
be productive, educational, and interesting. I enjoy watching that 
content, and so producing it will be similar in my enjoyment.

Winter break won't last forever, so it will be a challenge to see
how this evolves going into the spring semester. Hopefully
I will be able to keep up some sort of regular streaming.
