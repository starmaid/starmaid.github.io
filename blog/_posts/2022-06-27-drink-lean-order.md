Heres the rundown folks:

- Its 10 US dollars to cover cost
- I will ship anywhere. Idgaf. In the US thats probably going to be like another 10 bucks. International...that might be more.
- Every shirt is printed by hand, there will be unique variations, paint color may change slightly between shirts.

I'll close orders on July 4th, so I can move onto the next design.

## How this is going to work:

1. You fill out this form
2. I stop accepting responses on July 4
3. I start making shirts

### IF IM HANDING U THE SHIRT ($10)

4. u pay me when i hand it to u

### IF IM SHIPPING U THE SHIRT ($10+shipping)

4. I find how much it'll cost and tell you
5. you send me tha money
6. I put it in the mail
