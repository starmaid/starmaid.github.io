title: Breaking my Ankle

On December 26th, 2022, I fell down and broke my ankle. I got surgery about a week and a half later.

Unable to walk or drive, I stayed in Cleveland. I have never broken a bone before, so the thought of my friends signing my cast was a bright glimmer in my boring life. However, many of my friends live elsewhere.

I modeled my cast in Blender and set up a collaborative drawing site with an unwrapped texture for people to write on.

In the end, 26 people attempted to sign my cast, while 21 of them successfully wrote something on the cast (good job guys).

I also spray painted my crutches. This was just for fun. Just did a matte black base coat and then graffiti-like sprays to add some variety.
