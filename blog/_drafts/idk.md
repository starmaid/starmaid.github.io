what's the difference between a homepage and a blog? research THAT lol. homepages had 'handy links' back for when search engines werent great? or because this would be the homepage of your own browser, like a new page tab? that might be an interesting application of a website. 

i kind of want to touch on what social media looks like in other parts of the world? where are all the chinese citizens? what about india/middle east? these are the ones im most unsure about, so obviously those are the ones that i need to look into.




The benefits of a well-put together blog can be felt for an OFFLINE IDENTITY, with an easy place to link friends, family, strangers, and employers. Consequences for harmful or contested content are greater the closer the blog is to the OFFLINE IDENTITY. Content can safely be more subversive when presented by a PERSONA.
