the eroticism of the four piece rock band...you have to be close to each of them. you get sweaty. you work hard. hours of repeating. you drive yourself. you pull the creative direction of the group together. you fight. the rock band is an amplification of the self, both as a personality and as an artist - and literally, musically - as a drummer, you are responsible for all of the percussion. a bassist, all of the bass. every fuckup is yours, but so is every success. one change can be heard by the whole audience, palpably modify what you are creating as a group. solo singing in general is another whole thing

the atmosphere is rougher. ratty. the whole show is driven by you and others like you. the concerts are late, you have to lug your own stuff, you have to constantly deal with problems. drugs, alcohol, parties - inexplicably linked.

its also social, but its external...you deal with your friends, people whos houses you can play at, 'fans' as a concept. sometimes you become a recluse with work and band, and lose time for other things...its just you and the crew. erotic like mcr, nine inch nails, polyphia, crumb....all different, all sexy in their own way


but.......OUGHHHHHHH THE ORCHESTRA
you and 40 of your friends. maybe you dont know them all that well, but youre friendly (more on that later). you all got here because you focused for years to become skilled, adaptable, emotive. the personal journey, periodic tests, auditions, climbing a seat lineup. a meritocracy of skill and knowledge. the beauty of a set of rules, rich history, a concept of 'the masters' having come hundreds of years in the past and new ones always releasing new incredible pieces that you can excitedly pass the sheet music around

PLAYIGN with a large group....just the possibility of incredibly complex sound that you have to actively pay attention to the pieces of, and find the best way to add to it. being humble. knowing you are part of something larger that, in the best case, blends perfectly leaving no trace of your ego. 40 separate, very different people, all running whatever program in their mind allows them to follow the time, the director, and the music, and contribute. you know everyone is similarly skilled, theres no question about it. 

'rehearsal' instead of practice. set times during the day. shifting into a mindful state. rearranging chairs, assembling your instrument. the thing that happens when the director steps onto the podium. performances are well planned. daytime or evening affairs. you dress well. you have a room to rehearse in. the stage is swept beforehand. you shine your instrument. there are curtains. the lights are warm, blinding you to the expanse of a dark concert hall

ink and paper are erotic too but im not going into that here. just a side note

silence before the first note, anticipation....knowing youre about to run a marathon kind of feeling. the performance itself, the rules, the judges even, listening for the smallest things. high points and low points, pulling and pushing through the show as it is executed perfectly according to script, just like in so many rehearsals...applause has such a unique quality

instrument care is universal and kind of the same everywhere, but concert musicians are all about perfection....having a 60 year old instrument that was made by hand and (brass) shines like it just left the factory, (wind instruments) many tiny moving parts, you cant 'drop' one of these things

the smell of a space for concert band is like that of a library

hmmm onto social dynamics. whawt was that thing, that 50 people is the largest size for a group of humans to be self-organized? where you can instantly recognize all their faces, gaits, little quirks. you NOTICE when someone gets a haircut or does something different with their outfit. the size is also perfect for having people you arent...really familiar with - and as everyone knows, tension is the spice of relationships. networks form
its not a love square. its a love GRAPH. nodes and branches everywhere. nonacyclic, non continuous, ENEMIES, you can HAVE enemies. you can become friends with someone, fall out of anothers favor, never talk to some. its a diverse landscape for developing relationships. people can have dramatically different lives outside of the orchestra. of course, parties still happen, (less so in high school) but its kind of a different style. because you know everyone there. you know the faces. people have to have an 'in'

the sections are also kind of nice, its like having team. its your little team, getting together, having sectionals, working on your little piece, and then fitting it together with the rest. if the orchestra is the clan, the section is the family (more true in wind groups than strings-only groups eg. 7 trombones vs a 15 violin family)
