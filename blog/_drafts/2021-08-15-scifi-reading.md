# Sci-Fi Reading List

Like a lot of people in aerospace engineering, my favorite genre since I was a child is science fiction.

Heres some books that I have words I want to say about them.

### Neuromancer

pretty baller. Read it or whatever. Makes me wish hacking was that cool in real life.





### Asimov's Foundation Series

theres nothing quite like a large, tied together universe. book does a great job of making history feel like...history. its one thing to be told something happened in the past, but its another to have read it several years ago, and the current arc's characters have a fuzzy, incomplete knowledge of the events.

The whole series treats women pretty poorly. I guess it was the 80s, but there was better stuff out there.

the fourth and fifth books are very dry. asimov was TOLD to write sequels when the original trilogy started making money. You can tell. The fifth book gets nearly insufferable with just. 

### Ender's Game

i read this book in 2011, and i was in middle school.

i loved their concpets. i loved the way living in space affected the characters, and i loved the concept of play in space. 

what was it trying to SAY though?

also i found a copy at a local used book store that was sponsored by the us military.
