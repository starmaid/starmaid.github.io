This post will be a formalized set of musings I have had over the past several years about various command line utilities in the Windows 10 operating system. I could make an entirely separate post detailing why I am using Windows in the first place, but this is simply not the time. Everyone has reasons to use one OS over another, and this conversation of terminals happens after that descision is made.

The Unix shell, and the various terminals that can be used to access it, is the purest, rawest interaction a human can have easily with a computer. You could [bitbash a TTY connection over serial from an arduino](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XLZ4Z8LpEE), or [write machine code onto a ROM chip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnzuMJLZRdU) with a 555 timer and two buttons, but I'm talking about real things. You can [open up a TTY session on any linux machine with ctrl+alt+FX](https://www.howtogeek.com/428174/what-is-a-tty-on-linux-and-how-to-use-the-tty-command/) if you dont want to mess with any emulators. But realistically, we want some form of terminal emulation that gives us some extra tools, some visual customization, and usability that ensures real productivity.

There are also [many third-party terminal emulators for Windows](https://www.slant.co/topics/1552/~best-terminal-emulators-for-windows) that people love to argue about as much as people on the internet like to argue about anything. I'm just going to focus on the built-in emulators that will be on any computer you sit down at.
