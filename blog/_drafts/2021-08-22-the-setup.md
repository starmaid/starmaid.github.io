# The Setup

Sometimes people want to know what someone's setup is. I will be making some large changes soon, so I want to take a current log of my computer-related hardware.

## Computing

I have two computers that I use daily.

### Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5 1570 (2017)

- Intel Core i7-7500U @ 2.70 GHz (2 cores, 4 threads)
- 1x16 GB DDR4 @ 2133 MHz
- NVIDIA GeForce 940MX (2GB GDDR5 memory)
- 15.6 in 1080p touch display with active pen
- 512 GB Samsung NVMe SSD
- 512 GB Inland SATA SSD

This is the main laptop I got at the end of high school. The classic "college laptop". It was $999 at Costco. I was looking at stats and obsessing over components. My selection came as a result of several things. First, my dad had warned me several times about HP laptops. Friends don't let friends buy an HP, or so the saying goes. My price range was about a thousand dollars, so Razer and MSI were pretty much out of the game. Main manufacturers left on the table were Dell, Lenovo, Acer, Asus, and whatever else. I don't remember every part of the search.

I knew I wanted some kind of discrete graphics card, as gaming and CAD were both very important to me. However, at this time the GeForce 1080Ti was the peak of performance, and the insane jump those cards had was...not clear to me. Only the future would tell how big the difference between a laptop GeForce 940 and any of the 10-series cards was. Or the $200 increase in price was just too much. Either way, thats probably one of the main regrets I have, I should have sprung for a better graphics card. But this one has been functional.

I started looking into more things, like the chassis material (metal preferred), pen support (really desired), convertibles (not necessary, but cool). Lenovo and Dell had some of the best options here, with the XPS line and the Flex line nearing my price point. I also still stand by that the 15 inch screen is the best size, anything below that starts to feel cramped for multi-window workflows. This also was the size where discrete graphics cards started being introduced to the chassis. 

I ended up really using the convertible and pen a ton in college, so easily worth it there. Unfortunately, the 15 inch display was a bit unweildy for use in class. The desks at college were often unusually small, and the laptop just weighed so dang much that it was often easier to go without it when running or skateboarding to class. However, back at the dorm, it made doing online-submitted homework (almost all of it) that much easier. However, one friend's 14-inch flex model is WAY more handy for doing quick notes in class, and is both thinner and lighter. However, it was a 2019 model, and did not have discrete graphics. It would have been cool to reach a nice middle ground, but the bezels werent there yet.

The main problem I have with it now, four years later, is the thermals. I still use it in 2021 to play games, and the graphics card has enough grunt to get by on low settings.....until it starts thermal throttling. I currently have a custom fan setup that shoves air in the intake side, and have recently added an aluminum water block to really take the heat out of some metal parts of the laptop that were getting close to burning me. Playing modern AAA games takes way too much effort for this thing. But its all I have for now.

Another kind of rough spot is the battery life. I don't actually remember what it used to be, but I'm only getting like 2 hours out of it these days. I'm sure all the heat from gaming has degraded the cells, but its simply not a good look for the laptop. Some of my friends have even replaced the batteries from their lenovo Flex models.

Other weird thing: the single USB-C port on this device is only version 3.0. NOT version 3.1. This means NO DISPLAY THROUGH THE PORT, and NO CHARGING. That was a super annoying quirk, but again this was just around when USB-C was being introduced. Unfortunately, it means my docking situation involves four cables, power, HDMI, USB 3.0 adapter to ethernet, and USB-C for my peripherals. The 3.0 speeds with a keyboard and the ethernet started using all my bandwidth and eating keystrokes. Also means it only supports two displays, the built-in one and one external.

All in all. It was a good computer. I did what I needed to do (college) and played some fun games with friends. But its time for an upgrade.

### Lenovo ThinkPad T420 (2010)

- Intel Core i5-2520M @ 2.50 GHz (2 cores, 4 threads)
- 2x4 GB DDR3 @ 1333 MHz
- Intel HD Graphics 3000
- 512 GB Samsung Hard Drive

I was told in the syllabus for a class that I was taking in Fall 2020 that exams would be proctored through lockdown browser. I looked up the requirements, and it would not run if you had virtualization software installed on your computer. I of course use VMWARE pretty frequently, and think this is frankly ridiculous. Lockdown products are terrible and invasive. I had also been meaning to get a 64-bit laptop for experiments and stuff, as my last cheap craigslist buy turned out to be 32 bit. I compiled a couple dumb programs myself (as 32 bit isnt supported on linux anymore) before giving up and kinda setting it aside. 

So, I went on Ebay and grabbed "the $100 laptop", the T420. Heh. Weed. It showed up, I partitioned the disk in half, and put Ubuntu 20.04 on one half and left Windows 10 on the other. Great times all around. I installed Barrier and use it to make up my third and fourth monitors when I need it. Its really a great way to get around my 2 monitor hard limit on my Flex, and I figured out that three monitors is the best for productivity. One for messaging (Slack, Discord, Email), one for your main task (CAD, IDE, Word doc), and another for reference material (Web search, textbook, assignment sheet, etc). 

The battery life isn't great, but suprisingly its longer than my Flex. At about 3 hours, it has this weird thing where the battery meter goes down to 7% in about 45 minutes, and then stays there for the next 2 hours. Its a swappable battery, and my dad actually has a spare, but this one is in better health. I might make some changes to the battery monitor if i can, but for now I just wait until it drops to 5% and actually means the computer is about to lock up.

I don't expect this device to be a workhorse. But it runs 64 bit linux on hardware, which is better and easier than any virtualization that I have on my Flex. It was a good descision.
