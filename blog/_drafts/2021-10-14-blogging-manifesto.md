title: Manifesto of the Modern Blogger

This is a manifesto for the modern blogger. It says so in the title. It is a manfesto in the sense that it [states and describes my ideas, views, and goals.](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/manifesto) It is also a somewhat of an Art Manifesto,  

There is no shortage of blog manifestos, in fact by 2012 it seems every blog had their own statement of purpose. But I am here, a decade later, to try and list what is different. The cementing of Web 2.0 in the latter half of the 2010's has changed things, with the concentration of the interactive web onto the few major social media sites. I think this is helpful for some things () but detrimental for others ().

I'm mixing this manifesto with some hacker content that I've absorbed recently.
