This is a manifesto for the modern blogger. It is a MANIFESTO in the sense that it [states and describes my ideas, views, and goals.](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/manifesto) It is also a somewhat of an ART MANIFESTO, where I outline what THE BLOGGER is, what they stand for, and how to be one. When i use THE BLOGGER, I refer to only the type of creator as outlined in this document. This is an opinion piece for what I see in my life and on the web. This does not contain technical details on how to run a blog.

There is no shortage of blog manifestos, in fact by 2012 it seems [every](http://jamesgstewart.com/blogging-manifesto/) [blog](https://www.socialmediatoday.com/content/manifesto-blogging) [had](https://chrisbrogan.com/stories/social-media/if-you-intend-to-blog-seriously/) [their](https://cbcmanifesto.blogspot.com/) [own](http://www.ocdqblog.com/home/the-mullet-blogging-manifesto.html). But I am here, a decade later, to approach what is different. There has been a cementing of WEB 2.0, with a concentration of users onto the few major social media sites. I think this is helpful for some things (more people can easily share digestible ideas) but detrimental for others (a platform serves advertisers, not users).

I'm mixing this manifesto with some other tech/hacker mindsets. See the *Other Readings* section at the end for some influences. More will be added to this post as i find them.

EDITING NOTES: GO BACK AND LOOK FOR WHAT IS NEW, WHAT IS OBVIOUS, AND WHAT IS ESTABLISHING MATERIAL

WHAT DO WE WANT THE MODERN BLOGGER TO BE? HOW WILL IT BE BETTER?

## 1. The Blogger Exists

THE BLOGGER has three options. First, to blog publicly and openly as their OFFLINE IDENTITY. Second, to blog in a restricted sphere, but still as their OFFLINE IDENTITY - a RESTRICTED IDENTITY. Third, to blog truly anonymously, as a PERSONA. THE BLOGGER must make this choice, and resist temptation to mix these spheres.


## 2. The Blogger Posts

THE BLOGGER must make public posts on the internet. It is recommended there be a regular schedule. There doesn't have to be. A common trend among content creators is the struggle to determine if something is 'good enough' for public view. Published is better than perfect. Now is better than when the topic doesn't matter anymor, but never slave to an algorithm. THE BLOGGER finds a balance.


## 3. The Blogger Thinks

THE BLOGGER thinks about the content on the blog. Who is the AUDIENCE, and how will the content be recieved? Is the FORMAT appropriate for the content? What is the PURPOSE of writing and publishing the content? Should the IDEAS be distilled into their purest form, or should no DETAIL be spared? What are the DANGERS of posting this content? What must be said, and what can be left unsaid?


## 4. The Blogger is Authentic

THE BLOGGER has a responsibility for AUTHENTICITY, and to a lesser extent, TRUTH. Misrepresenting a community, emotion, or experience is untenable. Finding sources is expected. THE BLOGGER should mind the line between OPINION and TRUTH, using sources when appropriate. There is no reason a blog should be separate from art. But UNTRUTHS can be as harmful for THE BLOGGER as they are for the SUBJECT.

AUTHENTICITY comes with a corrolary of RELEVANCE and CONTEXT. THE BLOGGER uses their medium to include information that would have to be assumed on other platforms. Specific ideas only make sense when their time and surroundings are explicit. Outdated ideas can be discussed, but should not be presented as current.


## 5. The Blogger Hoardes

Hosting sites rise and fall, and sites implement changes or censorship at short notice. Technologies that support blogging can fall into disrepair in a matter of years. THE BLOGGER must have no attachment to a particular hosting site or method. Content should be backed up locally, and THE BLOGGER must be ready to restructure should the need arise.

Not only is the primary content vulnerable, but supporting content can be destroyed by LINK ROT. THE BLOGGER minds the ephemerable nature of web content and saves all things necessary to them. Remote content that is critical to the message of a post should be SAVED. Remote content that adds value but is not necessary should be CLEAR in what it contains.


## 6. The Blogger Chooses

At the end of it all, THE BLOGGER is free to do whatever they please. Burn these rules, flame me in the comments. Engage with an audience, or don't. Everything is up to interpretation, something could be consistent or stagnant, depending on the viewer. 


**Am I wrong? Tell me in the comments.**
