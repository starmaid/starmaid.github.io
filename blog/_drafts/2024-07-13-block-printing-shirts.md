I like making stupid little shirts. I think screenprinting is a lot of effort, especially for runs with less than like 20 shirts. I don't exactly have an audience that would buy that many shirts, and I also don't want to start printing shirts full time just because I have a few funny jokes to make. Thus, I set out looking for a more efficient way to make designs.

I tried the iron-on printer sheets, which totally work! They just are TOO digital. I want to involve real ink, and hopefully last a bit longer. Two-tone or maybe three-tone maximum.

## The concept

My friend Ian used linocut printing to make a custom shirt for his boyfriend Harry's birthday. This opened my mind up to doing stamping. The pattern was really clear, and linocut seemed to take some practice but wasn't the most difficult thing. It worked well!

The other aspect, however, was that I wanted to generate these stamps with a computer. This would allow me to do very clean design work and then line up multiple colors super carefully. The misalignment during printing would still make it organic, but I prefer that look to actual stamps that aren't sized properly. 3D printing seems like a good way to get material set down.

## Testing

I couldn't find any forum posts or blogs about doing this exact kind of thing. This would mean I would have to test...

### Material

I first tried a simple test between rigid PLA and the flexible TPU plastic. Same mini version of stamp, and done on paper.

The results seem to say PLA is better. My theory is that the center of large stamp areas were flexing inward, not applying pressure to the surface of the paper. This would reduce performance.

### Surface Finish

At the end of the material tests, I still felt like not enough ink would stay on the surface of the stamp. I tried sanding the PLA surface to both smooth out bumps that would reduce surface contact, as well as add micro-grooves for ink to reside in.

Personally, hard to say. I don't think it hurt!

### Braying Technique

I then stopped hand-painting ink onto the stamp and tried a few different methods of getting ink on. The sponge brush and rubber brayer were pitted against each other.

The sponge needed to absorb so much ink before it could deposit any reasonable amount. The rubber brayer just feels like it slips around and squishes ink out in front. I don't think I've cracked the mystery on these yet, unless I'm just supposed to use very little ink!

### Substrate Composition

Should the material underneath the printing surface be rigid or flexible?
