choose one of those titles. why is it 2022? not a different year? short answer: we are already pretty far done with 2021, a bit late to start something. but you cant choose this on day one of 2022, u need preparation. i think we are reaching a critical mass of social media saturation, dominated by a few large companies. the oligarchy of modern media.

i feel like the long form post with sources and structure has become somewhat of an elite format. only journalists write news, and entitled pricks write thinkpieces. the humble blogger no longer exists to make more personal pieces. the proletariat uses twitter to make snappy remarks that end up in buzzfeed compilations. we need to get back to really understanding and thinking critically about cultural content on the web.

what's the difference between a homepage and a blog? research THAT lol. homepages had 'handy links' back for when search engines werent great? or because this would be the homepage of your own browser, like a new page tab? that might be an interesting application of a website. 

tumblr and Facebook are micro blogging, Twitter is perhaps picoblogging. the concept of blogging broken down into its smallest component building block. a single fact or opinion is an entire post, with no support

i kind of want to touch on what social media looks like in other parts of the world? where are all the chinese citizens? what about india/middle east? these are the ones im most unsure about, so obviously those are the ones that i need to look into.

the death of the forum might be a worthwhile topic to bring up. loss of permanent, archived discussion in favor of real time communication over messages which are NOT a replacement is going to do severe damage to the blogospheres ecosystem. if we move to a format where peoples words STAY visible, such as on blogs, and with comment threads, etc, people will think more about posting and behave in forums. 

This sounds like an exerpt from [a course on web media](https://public.wsu.edu/~campbelld/blogmanifesto.htm), but there is a price to pay for not attempting to answer these questions before posting. These may also sound ridiculous to ask of a product review blog, or when the 'ideas' are long-form rambles about an everyday experience, but deciding "I am writing a post so I have a record of these thoughts" and "I am writing this post to spread an idea" are completely different things. 

The benefits of a well-put together blog can be felt for an OFFLINE IDENTITY, with an easy place to link friends, family, strangers, and employers. Consequences for harmful or contested content are greater the closer the blog is to the OFFLINE IDENTITY. Content can safely be more subversive when presented by a PERSONA.
