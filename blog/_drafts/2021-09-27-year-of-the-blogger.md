Intro
- this is not a manifesto, thats the other document
- this is a companion piece
- why is this necessary
- why now


[court hearing link?]() The oligarchy of tech companies are tightening their strangle hold on internet media. Yet, I rely on these platforms to interact with people outside of my close personal circle and immeidate geographical region. These platforms are also how I connect with others in interest circles, political groups, art groups, and anything else. The internet was built to enable these links, but it seems the towers are built too tall. Social media has commodified and gamified to unbearable levels. This is a sickness.

My response comes subtly. There was a time before advertisers dominated the web, when it was a smaller collection of users who shared content to enrich their lives - not competing for points. When posts were long form, when the content of an article was discussed, not the headline. Bringing these concepts into the current day is a


### The Manifesto

*"Our annual opportunity to place a steady hand upon the rudder of the new year is here" - Justin McElroy*


### Why 2022?

The question can be raised: "Why 2022?" 

choose one of those titles. why is it 2022? not a different year? short answer: we are already pretty far done with 2021, a bit late to start something. but you cant choose this on day one of 2022, u need preparation. i think we are reaching a critical mass of social media saturation, dominated by a few large companies. the oligarchy of modern media.


### The Long Form Post

i feel like the long form post with sources and structure has become somewhat of an elite format. only journalists write news, and entitled pricks write thinkpieces. the humble blogger no longer exists to make more personal pieces. the proletariat uses twitter to make snappy remarks that end up in buzzfeed compilations. we need to get back to really understanding and thinking critically about cultural content on the web.

Shallow interaction with content harms the reader and the writer - and we are all both. The writer feels they were not understood, and the reader does not feel fulfilled.

tumblr and Facebook are micro blogging, Twitter is perhaps picoblogging. the concept of blogging broken down into its smallest component building block. a single fact or opinion is an entire post, with no support


### The Death of the Forum

the death of the forum might be a worthwhile topic to bring up. loss of permanent, archived discussion in favor of real time communication over messages which are NOT a replacement is going to do severe damage to the blogospheres ecosystem. if we move to a format where peoples words STAY visible, such as on blogs, and with comment threads, etc, people will think more about posting and behave in forums. 


### Archetypes

Reposter:


what's the difference between a homepage and a blog? research THAT lol. homepages had 'handy links' back for when search engines werent great? or because this would be the homepage of your own browser, like a new page tab? that might be an interesting application of a website. 

i kind of want to touch on what social media looks like in other parts of the world? where are all the chinese citizens? what about india/middle east? these are the ones im most unsure about, so obviously those are the ones that i need to look into.


using other social media platforms have the advantage of finding new people far outside your social sphere with almost zero effort. For this reason, I have zero expectation of dropping things like twitter outright. in fact, i think it would be detrimental to stop using these platforms. however, they should be treated like foreplay for the more intimate long form blogging. when you find an artist you care about, or someone who posts analysis you find interesting, then interact on the realer post.


This sounds like an exerpt from [a course on web media](https://public.wsu.edu/~campbelld/blogmanifesto.htm), but there is a price to pay for not attempting to answer these questions before posting. These may also sound ridiculous to ask of a product review blog, or when the 'ideas' are long-form rambles about an everyday experience, but deciding "I am writing a post so I have a record of these thoughts" and "I am writing this post to spread an idea" are completely different things. 

The benefits of a well-put together blog can be felt for an OFFLINE IDENTITY, with an easy place to link friends, family, strangers, and employers. Consequences for harmful or contested content are greater the closer the blog is to the OFFLINE IDENTITY. Content can safely be more subversive when presented by a PERSONA.
