# CNC Robot Arm

## Introduction

short overview

## Version 1

version 1 (december 2017)
this was balsa and servos


## Version 2

version 2 (summer 2018)
i did some designing and ordered the parts

## Version 3

version 3
did some sketches but nothing really. started some code

## Version 4

version 4 (summer 2020 + spring 2021)
breadboarded it and got the drivers and everything working over the summer


accidentally got some aluminum (excess from the lights, 4ft -> 1m) made some parts and printed them for the joints. metal rods from the construction flags coming in handy yet again

semester started, forgot about it for a while

winter break happened. intentionally made no progress

during the spring, had some free time i guess?? saturday march 13 apparently i soldered it together. spring was spranging. i got time.

i finished the mount and got everything running that weekend. the code i wrote so many years ago was working! now i needed to figure out how to control the speed....

switched from manually stepping the motors to using some stepper library. allowed me to control speed and run two concurrently. simplified the program a little bit.
