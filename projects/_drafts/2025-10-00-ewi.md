This is a classic example of "taking an exit ramp" from a project. I wanted to make my own version of an electric wind instrument (EWI) but also wanted to involve my friends in a fun group project.

## The Idea

The Akai EWI is a really cool. A novel method of MIDI interface with a computer, that makes you play differently than if you were playing on a keyboard. I don't know how to play saxophone, so I also think this would be a novel approach to music. Sure, [you can buy one for $900](https://www.guitarcenter.com/Akai-Professional/EWI-5000-Wireless-Electronic-Wind-Controller-1401202977489.gc), but that's stupid. Its fairly common practice for internet weirdos to make their own ones.

### Prior art 

Had to give a search for some classic, non-product, EWI constructions.

- The guy who invented the EWI [Nyle Steiner](https://www.patchmanmusic.com/NyleSteinerHomepage.html) has his own page of novel instruments.
- [MiniWI by @Trasselfrisyr](https://hackaday.io/project/11843-miniwi-woodwind-midi-controller) is a classic minimum viable product, simple construction with conductive copper pads.
- [Haxophone by @cardonabits](https://github.com/cardonabits/haxo-hw) is a good modern design with mechanical keyboard switches. Also uses fluidsynth.
- [Gordon Good](http://gordophone.blogspot.com/2013/01/a-series-basics-of-diy-wind-controllers.html) has been in the game for years, and also fun fact does projects at CCRMA at Stanford. Has a bunch of blog posts about non-ADSR synthesizers.
- There were also several builds at Opensauce 2025 that were generally similar to these builds.

### Our Build

First we have to talk about who the team was. I gathered a few friends, primarily Harry and Ian, and Brooke was also there. The first consideration we wanted to make was who the device was for. Each of us wanted to play one, and knew maybe 1 or 2 other people who might find them interesting if they worked. 

This led to a batch size of maybe 3-6 devices, which is a weird number. Its low enough that custom PCBs are still annoying and expensive, and any annoying processes in the construction steps would have to be somewhat repeatable. We also had no delusions that we would be making any money off this, so using like a $200/ea bite force sensor would probably not be a worthwhile inclusion. Goal was cheap, repeatable, and functional enough.

The gang went back and forth but we ultimately decided to separate the input management from the synthesizer part - use an arduino with its many input channels on one side of the versatile MIDI interface, and then connect it to anything downstream, a full computer or some embedded synthesizer. This also gave us a few off ramps to consider.

We also decided that using capacitive pads would be simpler to wire and easier/faster to play, so we decided to look into soldering to pads or tape or something.

## Side note: Off Ramps

Sometimes you realize you are done working on a project. Not that the project is complete, but that the remaining work is not novel or compelling. This is where the "off ramp" comes into play - a point where the project is presentable and demonstrates something interesting, even if the full vision is not complete. As my projects grow in scale, I find it more useful to build these points in from the very design and planning phase. I also want to note that this doesn't make me any less motivated to go through and finish a project - it maybe makes it even easier to approach large goals, because I know failure will still leave me with something.

I want to credit this idea and phrasing to Brooke, who really demonstrated it with her quilted jacket project. Link will be added here if she ever posts about it.

## Build - Part 2

Back to the blog post. 

### Parts List

This is for the MIDI instrument part.

Arduino Pro Micro
3.3-5V logic level shifter
MPR121 Capacitive touch breakout board
TM7711 ADC + Pressure Sensor

The next goal was to connect the pieces together. 

The breath sensors could break.

### Software Design

Button layout, reference akai manual

Desire to use fun bit math

Make some fun diagrams. Git clone the repo and actually add them

Testing. show video and upload to mytube

## Whats Next

I have like zero desire to build or design the rest of this thing, so I just finished the breadboard test. I don't think it will change the game, so only if other members of the team pick up the effort will I continue.
