This project documents some stage lights I made for my friend, musical artist [HALLIE](https://halliehertrick.bandcamp.com/).

## Background

We were taking pictures while getting drinks at [B-sides on Coventry]() when we realized we shared a love for blinding neon.

I showed some pictures of my own lights and she said she would love some for her shows.

## Design

So I have my own lightbars that I made for general purpose use. The original idea was to ███████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████, but I haven't actually done that yet. I currently use them as portable accent lighting, and decoration for my rooms. You can get some really cool effects with them pointed directly at the viewer, especially because they are so bright. the WS2812b lights I use run on 5V, so I can power them with a portable USB power bank for a relatively long time.

My own lights are usually set up by leaning them on something. I don't usually have any requirement for fast setup or teardown. However, with Hallie actually wanting to use these as part of a stage ensemble, we had to come up with a solution that makes sense. They had to be tough, but still stable. purchasing tripods was an option, but a little pricey. Some 3D printed solution was probably the best.

I also took a look at some prior art in the realm of freestanding stage lighting. The [Chauvet DJ Freedom Sticks](https://www.chauvetdj.com/products/freedom-stick/) go [for $600 for a set of 4](https://www.stagelightingstore.com/led-lighting-packages/99305-chauvet-dj-freedom-stick-pack). They are DMX-compatible, WiFi controllable, individually battery powered. These are probably the gold standard of what I was going to make, except I would go for a higher pixel density. 30/meter is way too sparse. 

## Control

My first idea for controlling the lights was lofty and involved.
