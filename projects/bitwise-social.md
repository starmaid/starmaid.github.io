## Introduction

introduce the project
its for class
three 3-week sprints

The rest of this page will delve into the details and descisions made while building this site.

## Development

I know the history is all in github, but i want to write it out here so others can read it and get a little insight into our process.

### Pre-Sprint 1

we had to learn javascript. I knew how APIs worked for tumblr, twitter, and discord (https and nice wrapped ones) but had never developed a backend. 

We had some preconceptions of the class, wanted to maybe make a different site. Forced to make twitter

We also watched tutorials for firebase, I set up a test project to practice deploying things and how to use their interface.

if you are reading this page planning on making your own firebase project, MAKE YOUR FILES A REACT PROJECT FIRST, THEN ADD FIREBASE TO THE REACT PROJECT. This prevented us from making a full react app, and had to use CDNs for things we ideally would not have.

### Sprint 1

made an html-only shitty version of the site

### Sprint 2

got halfway done converting it to react elements.

my page redirection thing failed because i didnt understand how bitwise hosted things

### Sprint 3

Finished conversion into react-based project. New page redirection that was hacked together. 

Infinite scroll working perfectly, I was really proud of that one.

### Further work

I closed the api rules

## Reflections

take this from the document we already wrote
